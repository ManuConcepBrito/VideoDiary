A normal diary only tracks what you write. Lumen tracks what you look like, and the full range of emotions your face conveys. Lumen helps you take daily snapshots of your life and allows you to tag them, retrieve them and edit them.

The project is entirely coded in React Native and it's based on brutalist design.
